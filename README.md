PrestaShop T-Com PayWay module
==============================

This is a [PrestaShop][] module that enables using T-Com PayWay payment service
in your internet store.

Installation
------------

The module follows the standard [PrestaShop][] module installation conventions.

* Copy the module folder into the `modules` folder.
* Log into store's administration back-end and enable the module.
* Configure as any other module.

Notes
-----

The module has been extensively tested on the 1.1.0.5 [PrestaShop][] release.
If using any other version be sure to test all your use cases.

Also, some of the PayWay parameters are still hardcoded in the `payment.tpl`
file so be sure to check it out if your use case differs.
